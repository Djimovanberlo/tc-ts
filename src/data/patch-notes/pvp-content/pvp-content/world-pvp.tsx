    'Azshara, Silithus, Eastern Plaguelands and Deadwind Pass now have PvP events that start every two hours. In these zones, there are a number of towers that can be capped, similarly to the towers in Hellfire Peninsula. The number of towers differs per zone. When one faction caps all towers, all players of that faction that are in that zone and participated gain honor and an Alliance or Horde Mark of Honor. During this event, neutrally aligned mini bosses will also appear. These mini bosses drop some rare resources for each player that participated in the fight. Defeating these mini bosses grants honor and will increase speed at which towers are capped for that faction. Participation in capping a tower or fighting a mini boss flags players on PvE servers.',
    'Gurubashi arena chest now contains a lot of gold, rare materials and recipes.',
