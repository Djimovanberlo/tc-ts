		'Various regions in various zones now spawn mobs and chests that reward honor when killed or opened. Some of these mobs are elite or even mini bosses. Mini bosses or chests may drop or contain a Badge of Honor for all victorious party members. This provides an alternative to just farming battlegrounds and offers a source of honor to which players of different factions would compete. Honor gained from these mobs and chests in each zone is subject to diminishing returns, so endlessly farming one zone is pointless. Only players whose level is near that of the mob or chest get rewarded honor.',
