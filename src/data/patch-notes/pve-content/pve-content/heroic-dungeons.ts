    'Heroic Dungeon bosses drop high quality rare and epic items. Some bosses and mobs have additional abilities and some dungeons have loot or events added, that changes the flow/route from normal mode dungeons. Some of these new routes can be shortened by lock picking. Heroic Dungeons cannot be manually reset, but instead reset each day. The following Heroic Dungeons have been added: Zul’Farrak, Maraudon, The Temple of Atal’Hakkar, Blackrock Depths, Stratholme, Scholomance, Dire Maul, Blackrock Spire*., Ragefire Chasm (Horde only), Shadowfang Keep (Horde only), The Stockades (Alliance only), Gnomeregan (Horde only).',
    '*Although (upper) Blackrock Spire is technically a raid, the quality of items dropped and number of Badges of Justice should be similar to heroic dungeons.',
    'Some heroic dungeons drop additional Badges of Justice. For example the two final bosses of Stratholme each drop a badge. Long dungeons like Blackrock Depths contain more than one Badge of Justice.',
