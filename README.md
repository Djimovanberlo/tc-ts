### TO DO

## General
- Phases
- World Buffs

## Races
### Human
- Something for casters to compete with gnomes (10% wand damage / crit?)

## Classes
### Druid
- Smth that increases effect of HoTs and DoTs @ resto (15-20 pts? 20-25 pts?)

### Mage
- Amplify / dampen magic: remove amplify? resist 1 dispel effect || dampen 100% resist 1 spell ~5/10 min cd
- Dampen magic gains spell resist || dampen magic chance to not consume
- Rename (possibly change icon) for arcane 11 pts
- Magic absorbtion tier up + reorganize consequences
- Replace new fire thing with Blazing Speed (tbc)
- Cold snap baseline
- Icy veins @ 11 pts
- Winter's chill is OP
- Something elemental @ frost

### Paladin
- Revert Blessing of Prot buff
- Revert salv changes
- Reckoning small chance to proc

### Shaman
- Add totem range to Totemic Focus? smth new totemic mastery?
- Enh should have to choose between resto-totem build and +dps-eleDevastation build; prolly eleDevastation to tier3
- Resto-totem = WF/RB; ele-dps = FT/WF
- Frostbrand increased dmg on slowed targets
- Keep eleDevastation @ tier 2; 
- revert crit from sham focus
- natures guidance to ele tier1
- Call of flame sawp with imp fire totems
- Improved elemental shields 75% chance to proc on crit, smaller chance on spells tbh --> only offensive spells + melee crit 100% chance?
- Lightning spells -.5 sec cast time; lightning mastery -.5 sec cast time bonus
- Stormstrike 10% nature dmg flat
- Revert mana tide
- Old totem mastery is fine. Replace imp ankh with a WF/RB enh synergize

### Rogue
- Smth new assassination
- Revert expose armor changes (don't know if sunder armor is the issue)

### Hunter
- BM buff can be better: resource generation
- Baseline: additional stable slot
- Smth mongoose bite

### Warlock
- Check & improve demo builds for sacrifice build
- Make Havoc more unique
- havoc should be accessible for 0/30/21 && 0/31+/xx

### Warrior
- 11pt arms 2 boring: victory rush?
- Double must have debuff arms 2 boring
- imp polearms rework
- 1h spec should be viable 0/21/30 dps build
- Commanding shout
- Thunder clap can be used in defensive stance
- Smth else imp slam talents - has to synergize with prot non-31 arms / prot builds and NOT synergize standard 1h fury dps
