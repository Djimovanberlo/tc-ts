### TO DO
- rework functions:
   - it is currently possible to reduce to 3 pts in a talent tier, while still having pts in higher tiers (try druid balance -> up to 11 pts, then remove pts from tier 1)
   - Seperate concerns: 1 function for left and 1 for right click

- Hunter: combine 5% parry and 10% health talents
- Paladin: Seal of Crusader smth
- Lock: smth new affli 31 + smth new destro
