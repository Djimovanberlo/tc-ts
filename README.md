### TO DO
- rework functions:
   - it is currently possible to reduce to 3 pts in a talent tier, while still having pts in higher tiers (try druid balance).
   - Seperate concerns: 1 function for left and 1 for right click

- Icons for rogue, shaman, warlock, warrior

- Hunter: Aimed shot baseline
- Mage: Arcane fix, fire & frost smth new
- Paladin: consecration baseline
- Rogue: smth for combat
- Shaman: frostbrand baseline fix
- Warlock: Dark Pact?; Demonic sacrifice; smth on tier 2 for sacrifice builds
