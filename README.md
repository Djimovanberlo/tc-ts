### TO DO
- rework functions:
   - it is currently possible to reduce to 3 pts in a talent tier, while still having pts in higher tiers (try druid balance -> up to 11 pts, then remove pts from tier 1)
   - Seperate concerns: 1 function for left and 1 for right click

- Icons for rogue, shaman, warlock, warrior

- Hunter: imp mend pet & imp res pet are too boring; imp scorp sting has overlap with mortal blood frenzy (arms war)
- Mage: Arcane fix, fire & frost smth new
- Paladin: consecration baseline & new 11 (more interesting aura mastery)
- Rogue: smth for combat
- Shaman: frostbrand baseline fix & elemental weapons talent frostbrand; more interesting totem mastery; something else in place of imp reincarnate
- Warlock: Dark Pact?; Demonic sacrifice
