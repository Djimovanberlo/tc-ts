### TO DO
- rework functions:
   - it is currently possible to reduce to 3 pts in a talent tier, while still having pts in higher tiers (try druid balance -> up to 11 pts, then remove pts from tier 1)
   - Seperate concerns: 1 function for left and 1 for right click

- Icons for rogue, shaman, warlock, warrior

- Druid: resto meme?
- Hunter:imp res pet too boring
- Mage: frost smth new
- Rogue: smth for combat
- Shaman: frostbrand baseline fix & elemental weapons talent frostbrand; resto meme?
